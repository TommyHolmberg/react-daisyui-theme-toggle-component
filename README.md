# ThemeToggle Component

## Overview

The `ThemeToggle` component is a React-based toggle switch that allows users to switch between light and dark themes on a website. This component is built with DaisyUI and Tailwind CSS, ensuring it is highly customizable and easy to integrate into any project that utilizes these frameworks.

The theme is persisted using `localStorage`, so users' theme preferences will be remembered on subsequent visits. Additionally, it checks the user's system preferences for light or dark mode if no theme is stored in `localStorage`.

## Features

- **Persistent Theme:** The user's selected theme is saved in `localStorage` and automatically applied on future visits.
- **System Preference Detection:** If no theme is saved, the component will check the user's system preference for light or dark mode and apply it accordingly.
- **Responsive Design:** The component is fully responsive, utilizing Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI for styling.
- **SVG Icons:** The toggle switch includes SVG icons for sun and moon, representing light and dark themes, respectively.

## Usage

### Installation

Ensure you have the required dependencies installed:

```bash
npm install react tailwindcss daisyui
```

After installing the dependencies, you need to initialize Tailwind CSS in your project:

```bash
npx tailwindcss init
```

This command will generate a `tailwind.config.js` file in your projectâ€™s root directory, which you can then modify to include DaisyUI and customize your Tailwind CSS setup.

### Tailwind CSS Configuration

In your `tailwind.config.js` file, ensure that DaisyUI is included in the plugins array, and the themes are enabled or customized as needed:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  // Other Tailwind CSS configuration...

  plugins: [
    require('daisyui'), // Add DaisyUI here
  ],
  daisyui: {
    themes: ["light", "dark"], // Enable themes or customize them
  },
};
```

### Implementation

Import the `ThemeToggle` component and include it in your application:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ThemeToggle from './ThemeToggle';

function App() {
    return (
        <div className="App">
            <ThemeToggle className="my-4" />
            {/* Other components */}
        </div>
    );
}

export default App;
```

### Component Props

- **className** (optional): A string of class names to apply custom styles to the theme toggle container.

## How It Works

1. **Theme Initialization:** When the component mounts, it first checks `localStorage` for a saved theme. If no saved theme is found, it checks the user's system preferences using `window.matchMedia`. If no preferences are detected, it defaults to the light theme.

2. **Theme Persistence:** When the user toggles the theme switch, the new theme is saved in `localStorage` and immediately applied to the document root (`<html>` tag) via the `data-theme` attribute.

3. **SVG Icons:** The toggle switch is accompanied by SVG icons representing the current theme, providing a visual cue to users about the theme state.

## Customization

- **Themes:** Customize the available themes in the `tailwind.config.js` file under the `daisyui` key.
- **Styling:** Use Tailwind CSS classes to style the toggle switch and its container. You can pass additional class names through the `className` prop.

## Example

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ThemeToggle from './ThemeToggle';

function ExampleComponent() {
    return (
        <div className="example-component">
            <h1>Welcome to the Theme Toggle Example</h1>
            <ThemeToggle className="mt-4" />
        </div>
    );
}

export default ExampleComponent;
```

This component will display a header and the theme toggle switch. When the switch is toggled, the theme will change between light and dark modes, with the preference stored in `localStorage`.

## Conclusion

The `ThemeToggle` component is an easy-to-use solution for adding theme toggling functionality to your website or application. By leveraging Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI, it offers both flexibility and ease of customization. Whether you're building a simple site or a complex application, this component will help enhance the user experience by providing a seamless way to switch between light and dark modes.
